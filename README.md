# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-Using-Parallelization
The most common operational constraints impose that the total demand
carried by a vehicle at any time does not exceed a given capacity, the total
duration of any route is not greater than a prescribed bound, and service
time windows set by customers are respected. In long haul routing,
vehicles are typically assigned one task at a time while in short-haul
routing, tasks are of short duration (much shorter than a work shift) and a
tour is to be built through a sequence of tasks. There exist several
important problems that must be solved in real-time. In what follows, we
review the main applications that motivate the research in the field of the
realtime VRPs.
• Dynamic Fleet management
• Vendor managed distribution system • Couriers
• Rescue and repair service companies
• Dial a ride
• Emergency service
• Taxi cab service
